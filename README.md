# Green Blog

Green Blog is a Django-based blog project designed to inspire the use of Sweden's "allemansr√§tt" (right to roam) and provide a platform for users to share and discover outdoor experiences through text and image posts. Users can create accounts, add and remove their own posts, like and comment on others' posts, and utilize geotagging and filtering posts based on location.

## Features

- **User Accounts**: Create and delete user accounts.
- **Posts**: Add text and image posts with the ability to delete your own posts.
- **Likes**: Like posts with a green leaf emoji.
- **Comments**: Leave comments on posts.
- **Geotagging**: Tag posts with a location.
- **Location-Based Filtering**: Filter posts by city or region.

## Technologies

- Django 4.x
- PostgreSQL (as the database)
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive design
- Whitenoise for static file management in production
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Heroku for deployment
